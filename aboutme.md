I have an academic background in Business Administration and Economics and professional experience in finance.  I decided to pursue data science because I like to be challenged, enjoy continuous learning, and love to see the impact that data-driven decisions can have on companies and individuals. This motivated me to enroll in a graduate program in [Interdisciplinary Data Science](https://datascience.duke.edu/) at Duke University, which I completed in 2021. 
   
**My Thoughts re Data Science:** 
In the era of big data, data is no longer a scarce resource as it used to be. What's scarce is the ability to turn data into something *useful*. That's where data science comes in. I like to compare a data scientist to a chef. A chef who can make a nutritious and tasty dinner from multiple random ingredients and who knows how to deliver it. I aspire to be that chef. What about you?
